    "# Reddit False Information Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and current situation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "In this project, we want to find out if if an algorithm trained on existing fake news datasets is suitable for detecting misinformation in the quite specific type of content posted on Reddit. To assess the predictions made by our Machine Learning model, we check the online status of the streamed content exactly one week after it was posted. Our four areas of interest and main questions / goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content moderation: determine if our method can be effective in filtering out misinformation compared to human content moderation\n",
    "- Resource use: is our method efficient and scalable for real-time Big Data analysis?\n",
    "- Reddit insights: analyze posts / comments classified as misinformation\n",
    "- Model applicability: find out if an algorithm trained on existing misinformation datasets is suitable for Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook structure\n",
    "- reddit.ipynb: This notebook contains everything related to getting data from the Reddit API (streaming real-time content, retrieving data 1 week later), applying a trained model for classification, calculating performance metrics and some statistics as well as analyzing and discussing the results.\n",
    "- ml_model_training[...].ipynb: The code and information related to the training of the ML models can be found in two separate notebooks (one for the model trained on the Truthseeker dataset, one for that trained on the Fakeddit dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reddit API changes\n",
    "Reddit has had a free API for 7 years now, however in April 2023 they announced that changes will come to their API. The result of the changes would be that third party apps that access Reddit’s API will need to pay on a request basis going forward. Therefore, by the end of June third party apps will either be shut down or need to pay $0.24 per 1.000 API calls. However, Reddit says that apps using less than 100 requests per minute through the OAuth client ID will continue to be able to use the API free of charge. One major remaining question is what Reddit classifies as \"one request\" - for example, with the existing information, it is not clear to us if continuous streaming (like in our project) would be counted as one request or if each streamed submission or comment appearing in the stream would be counted as one request. Since it was critically important for us to finish all of our tasks that access the API before the changes apply and the exact date was not clear (19th of June or 1st of July were the two possible dates), we did all of these parts before June 19th, just to be on the safe side. \n",
    "The official reason given by Reddit for the API changes was that users visiting the site through third-party apps may not see ads that Reddit serves on its website and first-party app, so it was not sustainable any longer for the company. In an “Ask me anything” by Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, it was announced that moderation tools that need API access will remain free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protests and blackout\n",
    "Almost 8.000 subreddits participated in an event called “Reddark”, where the moderators put the communities into private mode, so users could no longer access the specific subreddits. The blackout started on June 12th and the protest was aimed to last at least 48 hours, including some of the biggest subreddits on the platform. In total, subreddits participating in Reddark had a total of two and a half billion members (cumulative, not unique users).\n",
    "Over 6.000 subreddits stayed offline even after the 48 hours:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Affected subreddits with 40+ million users: r/funny\n",
    "- Affected subreddits with 30+ million users: r/aww, r/gaming, r/Music, r/Pics, r/science, r/todayilearned\n",
    "- Affected subreddits with 20+ million users: r/art, r/askscience, r/books, r/DIY, r/EarthPorn, r/explainlikeimfive, r/food, r/gadgets, r/gifs, r/LifeProTips, r/memes, r/mildlyinteresting, r/NotTheOnion, r/Showerthoughts, r/space, r/sports, r/videos\n",
    "\n",
    "An internal company memo was leaked which told employees that the blackouts did not really affect revenue and that the company's aim is to sit them out instead of responding to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Subreddit rules and moderation\n",
    "In our selected subreddits (r/news, r/politics, r/science, r/worldnews), the number of submissions is much lower than the number of comments (roughly by a factor of 100). One possible reason for this extreme difference could be the subbredit-specific level of moderation and the sometimes very strict rules for submissions. For example, in r/politics there is a set of domains for submissions which are approved, if a submission is not from the approved domains list it gets removed. Also, new accounts that have not reached a certain time on the platform yet have restricted access to posting. Even more, the submission title on Reddit really must have the exact same wording as the news article headline that is linked. Also, additional text below the title is often prohibited, so adding opinions to the submission leads to a removal because only original text out of the article is allowed in the submission. In addition, the news article that gets submitted must not be older than 1 week of the time posting.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cases predicted by the \"label\" attribute and the facts captured by the \"online\" attribute are not fully the same - these are not predictions and actual values for one and the same (clear) target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>ML model</b> predicts whether or not an input content can be classfied as misinformation (and <b>not</b> if such content, when posted on Reddit, is likely to be removed).\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>real data</b> indicates whether or not a specific Reddit submission or comment was removed from the platform (for <b>any</b> reason, not just for being misinformation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Truthseeker training dataset was very balanced quantitatively (approximately 50:50) and the predictions made by the trained model when it was applied to the stream were also quite balanced (but not 50:50) - this means that there is an enormous amount of false positives (content falsely classfied as misinformation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Across submissions and comments, accuracy (how much data was classified correctly overall) is between 50% and 60%, with recall (how much misinformation / deleted content was predicted correctly) typically going below 50%. Considerations that would otherwise possibly be made, e.g. discussing tradeoffs between recall and precision values and the related issue of finding as many target cases as possible vs. \"overshooting the target\", don't really make much sense here given the overall very low level of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do a sanity check, we trained an additional model after looking at the initial results, based on \"Fakeddit\" (see notebook \"ml_model_training_fakeddit.ipynb\"). The Fakeddit training dataset was more unbalanced (after removing all image-related content) and thus more closely resembling our streamed Reddit data. However, while it showed superior performance (compared to the Truthseeker model) at detecting misinformation in its own testing dataset, the outcomes for our streamed Reddit submissions are much worse. This is a bit surprising, given that models trained on the Truthseeker data should in theory be more suitable for making predictions for our exact \"real data\" (see above), i.e. whether or not Reddit content gets removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might (must!) be aspects in our pipeline that can be improved, to create a better model. Even despite the difference in nature of the training data and our real data, the Truthseeker results were disappointing - at least at first, but then most of the Fakeddit results made them look good in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Main learnings:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training an ML model to detect fake news / misinformation is complex. Better training data, better language preprocessing and better model fine-tuning would be needed.\n",
    "2. Tricking yourself or misleading the audience by not double-checking (or intentionally changing) the target of the evaluation metrics is really easy. In an unbalanced dataset with much more \"true\" than \"fake\" content - which is the case for real data like our Reddit stream data - setting the target to \"true\" (the default value for the sklearn.metrics functions is 1!) can easily yield 90% for some metrics even if hardly any misinformation is detected at all.\n",
    "3. Published datasets for ML training are not always what they appear to be at first sight. When reading through the associated papers (where available) and working through the dataset with pandas, we quickly realized that there are many assumptions and simplifications involved, that, while understandable, are certainly not helping the outcomes. There is no such thing as a \"gold standard\", general purpose, do-it-all misinformation dataset, no matter how many authors claim exactly that. The Fakeddit dataset we used mixes data about satire, fake news and manipulated image content, but we were unable to achieve good results using the satire and fake news parts of the dataset only. One of the reasons might be that there are no real \"fake\" or \"removed by moderator\" cases at all in the data, since the assumptions are basically: every Reddit post that is online after a year is \"true\", except for satire-related subreddits, where every post is \"fake\".\n",
    "4. Matching the training data more closely to the real data / use case, while necessary, might not be sufficient, as we suspect that the quantity of data would also need to be increased massively (see LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat in line with the general topic of fake news and misinformation, here's an example for point 2 above, showing the actual results and a possible summary / headline someone could create out of them:"
